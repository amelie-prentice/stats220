# stats220


## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a meme image and gif inspired by a meme I have found online. Though the original purpose was quite simple, I made sure to explore new ideas on my own as well

The primary inspiration for the project was this meme:

**However**, I had other sources of inspiration as well, especially aesthetics-wise.
